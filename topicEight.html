    <h1>CSS3 Transitions and Animations and triggering them with JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
        Another intersting thing that we can do is we can actually have a transition trigger using javascript. For example check out the box below.
    </p>

    <div id="divSeven"></div>
    <button type="button" onclick="f1()">Click Me</button>
    <p>The way this works is that I created a button with the event 'onclick'. When the button is clicked it will trigger/call the function f1(), which is designed to activate the tranition. Below is the code for how I was able to trigger this transition
        with JavaScript. </p>
    <pre>
        //html
        < div id="divSeven">< /div>
        < button type="button" onclick="f1()">Click Me< /button>

        //css
        #divSeven {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background: green;
          transition: background 10s, height 10s, width 10s;
      }
        //js
        function f1() {
          const square = document.getElementById('divSeven');
      
          square.style.background = 'pink';
          square.style.width = '200px';
          square.style.height = '200px';
      }</pre>
    <p>
        Of course you can choose to use any javascript triggering event such as onhover, onclick, onchange.. they will all work! Just use the code above and your tranition will be triggered via JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>That's pretty much all the important things you need to know to get started with using transitions!
