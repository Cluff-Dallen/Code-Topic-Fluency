    <h1>JavaScript: Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Arrays</h1>

    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>
        Loops are very useful in the computer world. The purpose and function of a loop is to excecute one or more statments a specific number of times. The number of times these statments are excecuted depend on the condition of the loop. There are four different
        kinds of loops that are used within JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>The loops are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>for loop</li>
        <li>for/in loop</li>
        <li>while loop</li>
        <li>do/while loop</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For Loop</h4>

    <p>The for loop requires the following syntax:</p>
    <pre>
        for (<i>index statement; conditional statement; incremental/decremental statement</i>)
        {
            <i>/* Statements to be repeated as long as condtion is true. */</i>
        } </pre>

    <p>
        The way this loop works is we have an index. This can be set to any value that you might need. This index is often what is incremented/deremented. For example if we set our index to 1 like this, <i>i = 1;</i> , than each time we go through the
        loop, the incremental statment will apply. That means if we set our incremental statment as <i>i++</i> than each time we complete the loop our index i, will increment by 1. But our loop will only continue, and our index will only increment as
        long as the condtional statment is true. It is possible to have an infinite loop, be mindful of this.
    </p>

    <p>
        An example of how a for loop works is shown below.
    </p>

    <label for="userInput">Input # of times you'd like to loop:</label>
    <input name="userInput" type="text" id="userInput" width="2px" style="width: 30px;"></input>
    <button id="submitButton" type="button" onclick="forLoop()">Submit</button>

    <p id="forLoop"></p>

    <p>
        This loop as you can see is designed to count up each number until it's reached the number the user input. The following code for such a loop is the following:
    </p>
    <pre>
        //create a string variable to store each number of the loop to display later.
        var text = "";
        
        //Increment i, as long as it's less than userInput, increment by + 1 each time.
        for (i = 1; i < userInput; i++)
        {
            text += i + " "; //add each number to text string
        }

        //display the text string showing each of the numbers you looped through!
        document.getElementById('forLoop').innerHTML = text;</pre>

    <h4>While Loop</h4>
    <p>In my opinion, a while loop is a much simpiler loop to use. It's syntax is as following:</p>
    <pre>
        while (<i>conditional statement</i>)
        {
            <i>/* Statements to be repeated as long as condtion is true. */</i>
        }
    </pre>

    <p>The way this loop works is that it will loop through the statements as long as the condition remains true. So "while" true, loop. If not true, don't loop.</p>
    <p>
        An example of how a while loop works is shown below.
    </p>

    <label for="userInput2">Input a # that you'd like to see decrease as long as it's able to:</label>
    <input name="userInput2" type="text" id="userInput2" width="2px" style="width: 30px;"></input>
    <button type="button" onclick="whileLoop()">Submit</button>

    <p id="whileLoop"></p>

    <p>As you may have noticed, this loop displayed it's current value starting from the user's input, and decreased by 1 while it was greater than or equal to 0. Once this condition became false, the loop came to an end. An example of how this can be done
        is shown below.
    </p>
    <pre>
        //create a string variable to store each number of the loop to display later.
        var text = "";
            
        //As long as userInput remains greater than or equal to 0, loop.
        while (userInput >= 0)
        {
            text += userInput + " "; //add the current value of user input to text string.
            userInput--; //decrease user by one each time looped.
        }
    
        //display the text string showing the user input decreaseing by one each time!
        document.getElementById('whileLoop').innerHTML = text;
    </pre>

    <h4>Do/While Loop</h4>
    <p>
        The do/while loop works very similarly to the while loop, except with an additional component! The addition of "do" allows you to guarantee at least one loop to execute before the condition is checked. This way, you always loop at least once!
    </p>

    <p>The while loop requires the following syntax:</p>
    <pre>
        do {
            <i>/* Statements to be repeated as long as condtion is true. */</i>
        }
        while (<i>conditional statement</i>); </pre>

    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>if statement</li>
        <li>if/else statement</li>
        <li>if/else if statement</li>
        <li>switch statement</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>If Statement</h4>
    <p>
        If statements are pretty straight forward and are used just like how you'd likely guess. If statement is a conditional statement that when the condition is met, and only if the condition is met, only then is the statement then executed. An example of
        the syntax is below.
    </p>
    <pre>
        if (/* Conditional Statement */)
        {
            //statement to be executed IF condition is true
        }</pre>
    <p>
        Optionally, the if statement above could be used with out the curly braces. But you must be careful doing so because than only the imediate statement following is affected. The curley braces allow for multiple lines to be affected. Below is an example
        of what the syntax would look like without the curley braces.
    </p>
    <pre>
        if (/* Conditional Statement */)
            //statement to be executed IF condition is true</pre>

    <h4>If/Else Statement</h4>
    <p>
        In addition to the IF statement, we can add an else statement. What an else statement does, is that we first check to see if the if statement is true. If it is, go ahead an execute that statement then. But, if this if statement isn't true, than the else
        statement will always be executed. The else statement is guaranteed to be executed if all other if statements fail. This can be a very helpful tool! Below is an example of the else statement's syntax in relation to the if statement.
    </p>
    <pre>
         if (/* Conditional Statement */)
        {
            //statement to be executed IF condition is true
        }
        else 
        {
            //if the IF statement didn't pass, instead do this!
        }
    </pre>

    <h4>Switch</h4>
    <p>
        Switch statements can save your life in specific situations. Let's say you're building a program to do something different depending on what the user inputs. You want to quit the program if they type q, display the information if they press d, add information
        if they enter a, and if they enter any other key to give them an error message. If you think about it, there is going to be a LOT of if statatements. There has to be a better option? Well there is! And for situations like this, a switch statement
        can be a great alternative. The syntax for a simple switch statement is shown below.
    </p>
    <pre>
        switch (/* expression */){
        case a: 
            //do this 
            break;
        case b: 
            //do this 
            break;
        case c: 
            //do this 
            break;
        default: 
            //if none of the above, do this instead
        }</pre>
    <p>Just to better explain what is happening here, our expression is be compared to each of the cases. If the expression matches a case, that code will be executed and then exit the switch statement But, if the expression didn't match any of the cases,
        the defualt statement will instead be executed. The break statement causes the switch statement to end. An example matching what we described earlier regarding userinput can be shown below.
    </p>
    <pre>
            switch (userInput){
            case a: 
                //add information
                break;
            case d: 
                //display information
                break;
            case q: 
                //quit program
                break;
            default: 
                //if none of the above, display an error message! Unreconized character!
            }</pre>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
        A function in JavaScript simply put is just a block of code designed to do some sort of specific task. It's a block of code that can be called at any time. A function has mutliple components such as the ability to return a value, or to accept paramaters.
        A barebone example of the syntax for a function can be found below.
    </p>
    <pre>
        //any function name can be used as long as name follows same rules as var.
        function nameOfYourFunction(paramaterOne, paramaterTwo)
        {
            //create a variable x to store the value of paramaterOne + paramaterTwo.
            var x = paramaterOne + paramaterTwo;

            //return the value of variable x 
            return x;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        The way this function works is that it's designed to take two paramaters, and then add them together into x. Than the value of x is retuned and can be stored/used elsewhere. Functions are used all the time. In fact all the JavaScript I've used on this
        page so far has been done using functions. I simpily build a function to complete a task I desire, and then call it where apropriate. I'll show you an example of a pretty easy function.
    </p>

    <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me and I will call a function called, myFunction()</button>

    <p>
        The code that I used to make this function work is shown below:
    </p>
    <pre>
        function myFunction()
        {
          color = prompt("Enter a color to have this function change the background!");
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = color; 
        }</pre>

    <p>
        The way this works is I have the html button set to call myFunction() when clicked. When the function is called it will immediately prompt for a color, and than set that color as the background color. There is nothing returned in this example.
    </p>

    <pre>
            var x = 5;
            var y = 10;
            var w = 0;
            var text = ""
            
            function addStuff(x, y) {
                x += 1;
                y += 1;
                w = (x + y);
                        
                return w;
            }
    </pre>

    <p>The above code is just a simple function that will take two paramaters, add 1 to each, than add them together. The function than returns the new total.
    </p>

    <button onclick="addStuff(x,y)">Click to call function</button>
    <p>When the function is called, the resulting math will appear here: <span id="addFunction"></span></p>

    <h2>Arrays</h2>

    <p>
        Array's are a very important part of JavaScript, in fact the purpose of using array's is to store multiple values into a single variable. This is extremely helpful and has a lot of different use cases. Array's are called very like a variable, except there's
        more to it. The syntax is as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
        var arrayName = ["ItemOne", "ItemTwo", "ItemThree"];</pre>
    <p>
        When creating an array it's important that we add the square brackets. Inside these square brackets we can put as many items as we would like. Each item if a string should be in quotes, otherwise any numbers can be entered in normally but all must be
        separated by a comma. Don't forget to add the semi colon at the end of this statement! Once you've created your array, there's a lot that can be done with them. For example you're able to add an item to an array using push(), or remove an item
        by using pop(). We can access the value of any given element in the array by using an index number such as <i>exampleArray[2]</i>, and if this exact element contained a value we would be able to access it. Examples and further explanations
        can be found below.
    </p>

    <h4>Creating Array</h4>
    <p>You can create an empty array with the following code:</p>
    <pre>var arrayExample = [];</pre>
    <p>Or you can create an array by adding a specific number of elements as such:</p>
    <pre>var array Example = ["Item1", "Item2", "Item3"];</pre>
    <p>
        This creates an array with three elements in it! Overall it's pretty easy to create an array. You can add about as many items as you want.
    </p>

    <h4>Accessing/Changing an Array Element</h4>
    <p>With the array we created, we can access the elements like so:</p>
    <pre>exampleArray[0] = "Element1";</pre>
    <p>The above code can be used to access any element assuming it exists. If we wanted to access the second element, we would just do "exampleArray[1]". It's important to understand that array's index starts with 0, not 1! Also important to know that when
        we use the above code, we're not just accessing an element, but we're changing it too. We changed the string stored in the first element of the array into "Element1".
    </p>

    <h4>Array Methods (Push, Pop, Length)</h4>
    <p>Not only can we access the elements in an array, we can also use methods built for arrays. Specifically we are able to use pop(), push(), and .length, these are all very useful methods. And I'll show you how you can use each of them!
    </p>
    <pre>var movies = ["Tron", "Cars", "Avengers"];</pre>
    <p>Now that the array has been created, let's attempt to add an element to the array using push!</p>
    <pre>movies.push("Aquaman");</pre>
    <p>Now the array contains {Tron, Cars, Avengers, Aquaman}. The element gets added to the end of the array using push. We can remove the last element on the array using pop();
    </p>
    <pre>movies.pop();</pre>
    <p>We've now removed the last element on the array. Now it's back to it's original state as {Tron, Cars, Avengers}. Last but not least I'd like to show you the .length property. We can see how many elements are in the array by using length. Below is
        how we can do it:
    </p>
    <pre>movies.length;</pre>
    <p>This should output 3! Since there are only currently 3 movies in our array. It's a pretty straight forward property but is helpful for many tasks Of course there are other methods that can be used but these are some of the most useful ones.
    </p>

    <h4>Associative Arrays Methods</h4>
    <p>It's also important to be aware of what an associative array is. We can create an associative array using the following syntax:</p>
    <pre>
        exampleArray = { key1: 'value1', key2:'value2'};</pre>
    <p>Of course in this example,oure values are strings but that does not have to be the case. We are able to access these values using array notation such as: </p>
    <pre>
        exampleArray['key1'];</pre>
    <p>This will let us access what ever value is in key1. Using this array notation, we can also change the value like so.</p>
    <pre>
        exampleArray['key1'] = 'different value';</pre>
    <p>As you can see it works much like a typical array in that sense. We can also change the value through propterty assignment.
    </p>
    <pre>
        exampleArray.key2='another different value';
    </pre>
